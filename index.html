  <div class = "intro"><h1>Just like other Americans,</h1><p>LGBT Americans have
families, work hard to earn a living, pay taxes, and serve
their communities and their country. A 2016 research paper
by Gallup finds that 4.1% of the adult U.S. population
identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.
Applying these figures to the total number of adults in
the U.S., this suggests that there are roughly <span class="txt anim-text-flow">12.3 million</span>
LGBT adults nationwide.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unfair laws, lack of legal protections,
institutional barriers, and stigma stand in the way of
these very basic goals. This report provides a highlevel
overview of the burdens facing LGBT Americans
as a result of this stigma and discrimination, as well
as a look at what organizations and individuals are
doing to make sure all Americans are treated equally
and fairly.</p>
