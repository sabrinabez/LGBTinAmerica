  <h1>Just like other Americans.</h1><p>LGBT Americans have
families, work hard to earn a living, pay taxes, and serve
their communities and their country. A 2016 research paper
by Gallup finds that 4.1% of the adult U.S. population
identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.
Applying these figures to the total number of adults in
the U.S., this suggests that there are roughly <b>12.3 million</b>
LGBT adults nationwide.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unfair laws, lack of legal protections,
institutional barriers, and stigma stand in the way of
these very basic goals. This report provides a highlevel
overview of the burdens facing LGBT Americans
as a result of this stigma and discrimination, as well
as a look at what organizations and individuals are
doing to make sure all Americans are treated equally
and fairly.</p>

    <p>The LGBT community is diverse and lives throughout
the United States; same-sex couples can be found in every
state and in 93% of all U.S. counties. People of color are
more likely than white people to identify as LGBT: 4.6%
of black people, 4.0% of Latino, and 4.3% of Asian people
identify as LGBT, compared to 3.2% of white people.</p>
<p>
A survey of more than 6,400 transgender Americans found that 24% identified as people of color.5 Young people are more likely to identify as LGBT: 7.2% of 18-29 year-olds compared to 3.2% of 30-49 year-olds, 2.6% of 50-64 year-olds, and 1.9% of people 65 and older. And women are more likely to identify as LGBT than men: 3.6% of women compared to 3.3% of men.</p>

<h1> No federal law provides explicit legal protections
for LGBT workers.</h1>
<p>The basic American bargain is that people who
work hard and meet their responsibilities should be able
to succeed and provide for their families. A significant
majority of Americans (72%) believe that workers should
be treated fairly and equally and that no one should be
fired for reasons that have nothing to do with their job
performance.</p>

<p>This basic bargain is not just an idea—it
is embedded in laws that promote equal access to jobs
and that protect workers from unfair practices. But these
laws do not protect everyone, despite the fact that nine
out of 10 Americans believe that a federal law exists
protecting LGBT workers from discrimination.</p>

<p>America’s estimated 5.4 million LGBT workers17 face inequality, unfairness, harassment, and discrimination in the workplace (see Figure 3). A 2012 survey in California found that 13% of lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults were unemployed, compared to 10% of straight adults.</p>

<p>Transgender workers have twice the unemployment rate of the population as a whole.19 According to the Williams Institute, more than one in four lesbian,gay, and bisexual (LGB) employees (27%) reported experiencing employment discrimination based on their sexual orientation in the past five years.20 The National Transgender Discrimination Survey found that 50% of transgender employees had been harassed at work.2</p>
